Build an AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) – Scalable Backend & API Implementation

🔹 Project Overview
Develop a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that processes messy Electronic Health Records (EHR) and provides:
✅ Smart parsing of EHR data (structured & unstructured)
✅ Real-time drug interaction detection (before prescribing medications)
✅ Early warning detection for critical conditions (sepsis, stroke, heart failure)
✅ AI-powered treatment recommendations based on research papers & clinical guidelines
✅ Clinical trial matching (suggesting relevant studies for patient conditions)

🔹 Backend Tech Stack
Component	Tech Stack (Options)
Backend Framework	GoLang / Python (FastAPI) / Node.js (NestJS)
Database	PostgreSQL (Relational), MongoDB (Document Storage), Redis (Caching)
Message Queue	Kafka / RabbitMQ (Real-time event processing)
API Gateway	Kong / Nginx (Load Balancer & API Management)
Authentication	JWT + OAuth2 (Secure API Access)
AI/ML Processing	OpenAI / DeepSeek / TensorFlow for Predictive Analysis
Logging & Monitoring	Prometheus + Grafana (Performance Metrics)
Cloud Deployment	AWS / GCP / Azure (Scalability & Security)
🔹 System Architecture & Data Flow
1️⃣ User Inputs (Doctor uploads EHR or queries API)
🔻
2️⃣ Backend Processing:

EHR Parser extracts structured data (diagnoses, lab reports, medications)
AI Model analyzes risk factors for sepsis, stroke, heart failure
Drug Interaction API checks conflicts between medications
Clinical Trial API matches patients to research studies
🔻
3️⃣ AI-Powered Decision Engine:
Fetches evidence-based guidelines (NIH, PubMed)
Provides custom treatment suggestions
🔻
4️⃣ Doctor Dashboard & Alerts (Frontend):
Displays risk assessments, flagged interactions, and AI-driven recommendations
🔹 Backend API Endpoints & Functionality

/api/auth/register	POST	User registration (Doctors, Researchers, Admins)
/api/auth/login	POST	Secure login (JWT-based authentication)
/api/patients/upload-ehr	POST	Upload & parse patient medical records (PDFs, JSON, text)
/api/patients/get-history/:id	GET	Fetch structured medical history for a patient
/api/drug-interactions/check	POST	Check for drug interactions before prescription
/api/conditions/analyze	POST	Run AI-based risk assessment for sepsis, stroke, etc.
/api/treatment/recommend	POST	Suggest evidence-based treatment based on guidelines
/api/trials/match	POST	Match patients to clinical trials using ClinicalTrials.gov API

🚀 Expected Output
A fully functional backend that:
✅ Parses medical records (EHR)
✅ Detects drug interactions in real-time
✅ Predicts critical conditions with AI models
✅ Provides evidence-based treatment recommendations
✅ Matches patients to relevant clinical trials
💡 Bonus:

Integrate an AI-powered chatbot that allows doctors to ask queries like:
"What’s the best treatment for Type 2 Diabetes with hypertension?"
Add voice-to-text EHR input support
