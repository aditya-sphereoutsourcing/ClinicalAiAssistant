# Clinical AI Assistant Backend

## Project Overview
This project is a backend system for a Clinical AI Assistant application that helps healthcare professionals with patient data management, clinical decision support, and medical documentation. The system processes medical data, provides AI-powered insights, and maintains secure access to patient information.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for healthcare professionals
- **Patient Data Management**: Store and retrieve patient medical records
- **Clinical Decision Support**: AI-powered analysis of patient data to suggest diagnoses and treatments
- **Medical Documentation**: Automated generation of clinical notes and reports
- **Secure API Integration**: Connect with external medical systems and databases

## Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing medical data
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access control for healthcare professionals
- **AI Integration**: Connection to clinical decision support models

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new healthcare professional
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate and receive access token
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh authentication token

### Patient Management
- `GET /api/patients` - List patients under provider's care
- `GET /api/patients/:id` - View specific patient details
- `POST /api/patients` - Add new patient record
- `PUT /api/patients/:id` - Update patient information

### Clinical Data
- `GET /api/clinical-data/:patientId` - Retrieve patient clinical data
- `POST /api/clinical-data/:patientId` - Add new clinical observations
- `PUT /api/clinical-data/:id` - Update existing clinical data

### AI Assistant
- `POST /api/ai/diagnose` - Get AI-powered diagnostic suggestions
- `POST /api/ai/treatment` - Receive treatment recommendations
- `POST /api/ai/document` - Generate clinical documentation
- `POST /api/ai/literature` - Search relevant medical literature

## Security Measures
- Encrypted patient data storage
- Role-based access control for different healthcare providers
- Audit trails for all data access and modifications
- Compliance with healthcare data regulations
